# Booksale

# Directory Structures

There are two main directory

1. Backend - This is where the backend code is that serves as a simple api to compute the total sales of the book. Created using typescript. Here you can also find a simple test suite using jest under the folder "backend/src/__tests__". The test run a number of test cases for the main computation logic found in "backend/handlers/calculator.ts"


2. Frontend - This is just the UI for you to enter the number of books ordered. Created using Vuejs.

# Installation

2. Frontend - Go into frontend folder and run "npm run server".
